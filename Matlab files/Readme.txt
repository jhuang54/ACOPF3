convert pss\e '.raw' files into matpower '.mat' file

Steps:
(1) open '\Matlab files\convert psse to matpower\main_psse2mpc.m', revise rawfile_name. If the raw file is 'Maui2022dm_v4_v33.raw', then rawfile_name='Maui2022dm_v4_v33.raw'.
(2) check whether you have buses which have no branches by printing 'isolated'. If isolated='', you don't have any isolated buses.
(3) '.mat' file is saved in '\Matlab files\output file\'
